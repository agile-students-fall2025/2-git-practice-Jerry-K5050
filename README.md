## Interesting Website
Here is the website I find interesting, which is about [the evolution of software developer salaries](https://codesubmit.io/blog/the-evolution-of-developer-salaries/).

 This website has some meaningful industry statistics for software engineering and software development. As in the provided statistic, we see a **significantly lower increment** - even a stagnation - in the mean annual pay of software developers and programmers than previous decades. Looking at the broader future trend, the author asserts that "industry experts expect low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete", which is kind of interesting as we now see the uprising of LLM such as ChatGPT and Gemini doing most of the easy, repetitive jobs for software development.

# Comment by Louis
Interesting read. Two caveats: (1) Pay stagnation may reflect cyclical hiring, offshoring, and title dilution as much as automation; decade-scale comparisons risk survivorship bias. (2) “Obsolete” is overstated. LLMs commoditize boilerplate, shifting value to problem framing, architecture, data quality, integration, reliability, and governance. Demand concentrates for engineers who can wield AI tools, reason about systems, and own outcomes. Expect fewer pure coders, more product-minded engineers and AI-augmented teams. Upskilling toward design, security, and domain expertise mitigates risk.

 Cool article! As someone interested in software roles, I think this article provides insight into the future of LLMs and how that will impact compesensation in the tech market.

Something interesting that the article mentioned was that over the decades there are less "programmers" and more "developers." This shows a change in the market's needs into product focused development as opposed to general back-end work.
